# Chatbot Product Information System

## Overview
This chatbot provides precise, product-specific responses to customer queries. It is designed exclusively to answer questions about the products it sells, delivering accurate and relevant information about pricing, availability, and product details. 

**Note**: This chatbot does not respond to any general questions or topics outside the scope of its product offerings. Queries unrelated to the items sold will not receive responses.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: The primary programming language used to build and run the chatbot.
- **OpenAI API**: Provides the language model powering the chatbot's responses.
- **Gradio**: An easy-to-use interface library for creating a web-based user interface for the chatbot.

## Features
- **Product-Specific Responses**: The chatbot is trained to provide concise and relevant information strictly related to products in the store.
- **Price Inquiries**: Users can ask about the cost of available products, and the chatbot will return accurate pricing.
- **Inventory Availability**: If implemented, the chatbot can also check stock levels for requested items.

## Usage
- **Example Query**: "How much does a pack of tomatoes cost?"
- **Unsupported Query**: "What is the weather today?" (This will not be answered, as it is outside the chatbot's scope).

This focused approach ensures that the chatbot provides accurate, product-related information efficiently, without irrelevant responses.
